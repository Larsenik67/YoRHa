                        As noted in the previous report, implementations of
                        Gestalt mode can prevent the white chlorination syndrome
                        we recently experienced. Transfer of bodily Information
                        to civilization-repressed Replicants is proceeding as planned,
                        with the genes of the Originals safely stored inside.

                        Our role as surveillance androids to prepare for when the 
                        incurable bacterial disease eventually dies out is also
                        underway. So far, this is proceeding without issue.

                        Project Gestalt Report 9182

                        This document discusses potential strategies for the relapse
                        cases we have observed in recent years. The term "relapse",
                        of course, refers to the catastrophic loss of sentience seen 
                        in certain Gestalts. This syndrome has defied even our most 
                        pessimistic initial estimates, and continues to trend upward 
                        with disturbing speed.

                        With some relapsed Gestalts beginning to attack Replicants,
                        there is an urgent need to take comprehensive action. We remain
                        convinced that an unknown technological defect in the Gestalt
                        transformation process is responsible for the condition, but so far
                        have been unable to confirm this theory.

                        Research of this condition is now our top priority, and looks likely
                        to continue for some time.

                        Project Gestalt Report 11242

                        We have determined that the rise of relapses was due to an unexpected spide in the
                        sentience of Replicants, as well as genetic instability within the original Gestalt.
                        (It seems the Original's effect on body that have undergone the Gestalt processe was
                        not anticipated in advance.)

                        Immediate action must be undertaker to identify the links between this trand and the original
                        Gestalt--along with its sister, the relapsed case known as Yonah.

                        The Observer Contact Group is growing uneasy, so finding a solution to the relapse issue should
                        be considered a top priority. (See other reports for more details.)
