    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <figcaption>
    <figure>YoRHa's androids are divided into specific models for defined roles. <br/><br/>
        In the current classification system, each unit is denoted by a number followed by
        a letter indicating their model type: this replaced the older longform system
        used at the inception of YoRHa, where units were referred to by their full model
        type followed by "Number" and their number, shortened to just the latter (eg
        "Attacker Number 2," shortened to "Number 2" or "No 2"). <br/><br/>
        Models from the older designation system have the reverse of the modern coding system (Attacker Number
        2 is referred to as A2, while the modern designation for such a model would be
        2A). <br/><br/>
        Current-production units regard the shorthand version of their designation
        as their name. Over time, models were phased out, updated, or added on to face
        the ongoing threat. <br/>
        
        Known models include: <br/> <br/> 
        <ul>
            <li>
            A - Attacker: specialized in
        close-ranged combat, with exceptional dash abilities and an experimental
        "berserk mode" ("B mode") only used in this variant. Obsolete, but known to have
        been present among YoRHa android prototypes deployed during the Pearl Harbor
        Descent, and among the prototypes that formed the M002 male squad. </li>
        <br/><li>
            B - Battler:
        all-purpose combat unit, a hybrid of the A and G prototype models. This type was
        developed by utilizing the battle data on No2 from the Pearl Harbor Descent
        Mission.</li> 
        <br/><li>
            C - Canceller: specific purpose unknown, but believed to be tasked with
        hiding YoRHa signals during descents from the Bunker, as evidenced by the only
        known unit of this type's presence during the Pearl Harbor Descent Mission.
        Appears to be obsolete, with later model flight units having their own signal
        cancellers, without the need for a designated unit. </li>
        <br/><li>
            D - Defender: focused on
        defensive tactics such as the use of barriers, and heavily reinforced against
        the Logic Virus. E - Executioner: combat model specifically designed for
        anti-android operations.</li>
        <br/><li> 
            E-models are often covertly deployed and given another
        type designation, charged with monitoring and, if need be, eliminating androids
        who have violated YoRHa's policies in some way, including those at risk of or in
        the process of deserting, and those in unauthorized possession of classified
        information. E-models seem to be functionally similar to B-models regardless of
        their designation.[2][3]</li>
        <br/><li> 
            G - Gunner: specialized in long-range combat. Obsolete,
        but known to have been present among YoRHa android prototypes deployed during
        the Pearl Harbor Descent Mission, and among the prototypes that formed the M002
        male squad. </li>
        <br/><li> 
            H - Healer: specialized repair unit, with additional tools both for
        repairing physical damage and dealing with data corruption and electronic
        warfare. H-models were at one point also responsible for uploading squad black
        box data to the Bunker, though this ability seems to have been added to Scanner
        models as well at some point. </li>
        <br/><li> 
            O - Operator: logistical model, provides intel and
        missions for units in the field as well as collecting and compiling
        command-level data for operations in the orbital stations. One Operator is
        assigned to each combat unit in the field. The O series are not designed for
        combat, and are not permitted to leave the orbital stations. </li>
        <br/><li>
            S - Scanner: scout
        unit with additional sensor capabilities and a comprehensive hacking suite for
        gathering data. Also charged with uploading the personality data of themselves
        and their companions to the Bunker to preserve it in case their body is
        destroyed. S models are especially unique being the only current-production male
        YoRHa androids, due to testing finding that male combat-focused models were
        stronger but poor at cooperation.[4] YoRHa androids are able to switch roles at
        their own request, presumably by having their data uploaded to a body of another
        model type.</li>
        <br/><li> 
        The Commander is an older android model, hence her non-standard
        YoRHa codename: White. Prior to her command of YoRHa, she was a member of the
        Resistance on Earth and an acquaintance of the android known as Jackass.</li>
