                    <h2>YoRHa's androids models</h2>
                    <blockquote>YoRHa's androids are divided into specific models for defined roles.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In the current classification system, each unit is denoted by a number followed
                        by a letter indicating their model type: this replaced the older longform system
                        used at the inception of YoRHa, where units were referred to by their full model
                        type followed by "Number" and their number, shortened to just the latter (eg
                        "Attacker Number 2," shortened to "Number 2" or "No 2").
                        <br/><br/>
                        Models from the older designation system have the reverse of the modern coding
                        system (Attacker Number 2 is referred to as A2, while the modern designation for
                        such a model would be 2A).
                        <br/><br/>
                        Current-production units regard the shorthand version of their designation as
                        their name. Over time, models were phased out, updated, or added on to face the
                        ongoing threat.

                                A - Attacker: specialized in close-ranged combat, with exceptional dash
                                abilities and an experimental "berserk mode" ("B mode") only used in this
                                variant. Obsolete, but known to have been present among YoRHa android prototypes
                                deployed during the Pearl Harbor Descent, and among the prototypes that formed
                                the M002 male squad.

                                B - Battler: all-purpose combat unit, a hybrid of the A and G prototype models.
                                This type was developed by utilizing the battle data on No2 from the Pearl
                                Harbor Descent Mission.</li>

                                C - Canceller: specific purpose unknown, but believed to be tasked with hiding
                                YoRHa signals during descents from the Bunker, as evidenced by the only known
                                unit of this type's presence during the Pearl Harbor Descent Mission. Appears to
                                be obsolete, with later model flight units having their own signal cancellers,
                                without the need for a designated unit.

                                heavily reinforced against the Logic Virus.

                                H-models were at one point also responsible for uploading squad black box data

                                O - Operator: logistical model, provides intel and missions for units in the
                                field as well as collecting and compiling command-level data for operations in
                                the orbital stations. One Operator is assigned to each combat unit in the field.
                                The O series are not designed for combat, and are not permitted to leave the
                                orbital stations.

                                data of themselves and their companions to the Bunker to preserve it in case
                                their body is destroyed. S models are especially unique being the only
                                current-production male YoRHa androids, due to testing finding that male
                                combat-focused models were stronger but poor at cooperation.[4] YoRHa androids
                                are able to switch roles at their own request, presumably by having their data
                                uploaded to a body of another model type.</li>

                                YoRHa androids are able to switch roles at their own request, presumably by
                                having their data uploaded to a body of another model type. The Commander is an
                                older android model, hence her non-standard YoRHa codename: White. Prior to her
                                command of YoRHa, she was a member of the Resistance on Earth and an
                                acquaintance of the android known as Jackass.</li>

                    <h2>Characteristics and Behavior</h2>
                    <br/>
                    <blockquote>YoRHa androids have a variety of hair colors, including tones not
                        common in humans such as white and red. They typically have dark eyes and wear
                        black uniforms or armor. The only unit in YoRHa who does not follow this
                        clothing code is the Commander, who wears either white or green. Due to their
                        heavily reinforced combat frames, a YoRHa android is about two and a half times
                        the weight of a healthy human of equivalent size. Combat androids are supposed
                        to have a personality defined by their unit class (B being neutral, S
                        inquisitive, etc) but in practice YoRHa models display a range of personality
                        types similar to their human creators. Units with the same number all share a
                        common base personality construct, though their experiences can radically alter
                        this in practice.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        YoRHa units can perform most actions a human could, including sleeping, eating
                        and drinking, though these are not required and performed only as and when the
                        unit feels like it. Their body structure does mean that certain foods,
                        particularly <span class="flou">oily fish</span>, will seriously compromise their functionality. The
                        combat chassis is largely self-cleaning with only occasional replacement of
                        filters needed to maintain peak performance, although some units prefer to bathe
                        regularly as they enjoy how it feels. There is apparently also some aspect of
                        their function that requires them to breathe, since it is possible to strangle a
                        YoRHa unit. They cannot naturally reproduce and are not fitted with any kind of
                        genitals by default, though they can request this if they so choose, seemingly
                        purely for recreational purposes.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        It is known that combat and killing creates a pleasurable sensation for YoRHa
                        androids: some unscrupulous non-YoRHa models have used data gathered from combat
                        androids to synthesize "electronic drugs" that replicate this feeling.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        The main distinction between YoRHa androids and the other Resistance androids
                        remaining on the Earth's surface are their Black Boxes. These devices, derived
                        from <span class="flou">Machine Lifeform power cores</span>, function as a combination of power cell and
                        memory module, effectively being the unit's brain and heart. The device appears
                        to have some kind of wireless link to the unit it belongs to as both 2B and 9S
                        were shown still functional while holding their Black Boxes in their hands on
                        two occasions, though it is unclear how long this state could be sustained. Data
                        can be synchronized from the Black Box to the Bunker, allowing a unit to
                        effectively survive their own death with all of their memories up to the point
                        of their last backup intact. In addition, the data can be transmitted and
                        uploaded to a stored android body. This is shown to be a process of transferring
                        rather than copying with no discontinuity in consciousness, the android
                        perceiving it as if they had been teleported to the new body's location.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        The energy stored within the Black Box can also be unleashed in a devastating
                        explosion: while this is usually performed by touching two Black Boxes together,
                        a single YoRHa unit is capable of initiating the destruction of their Black Box.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        A common phrase used as a greeting, salutation, and dismissal in YoRHa is "Glory
                        to Mankind", which often is given out at the end of high profile messages as
                        well as those from the Council of Humanity itself. The slogan also appears on
                        YoRHa weapons, messages, and screens when they are not in use, all as a constant
                        reminder of the androids' purpose. It is normally said in a salute with one's
                        left hand placed flat over their chest.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        YoRHa models have superior combat abilities to previous android lines, and also
                        boasted complete resistance to the Logic Virus when first deployed, though the
                        machines quickly adapted.

                    <br/>
                    <blockquote>YoRHa combat models typically use high-tech bladed weapons in their
                        missions, though the manipulator system used by combat units (called the
                        near-field combat system, NFCS) to control their weaponry can in practice
                        interface with virtually any object, from a purpose-built weapon to a discarded
                        Iron Pipe. The manipulator fields produced by NFCS take the form of a series of
                        glowing translucent golden halo-like rings along the length of whatever the
                        field is holding, and allow movement in ways that would be impossible if the
                        android handled weapons with only their hands.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Combat models usually wear clothing in the ancient human Gothic Lolita style,
                        though they can be issued heavy body armor for more dangerous missions. Their
                        garments are not just clothing and supplement the unit's functionality, with the
                        skirt worn by B-models and the pants of S-models being part of the unit's heat
                        dissipation system. They typically wear a black visor resembling a blindfold
                        that is equipped with a variety of sensors, though their eyes are perfectly
                        functional without it. Being as Operator models are strictly non-combat units,
                        they do not wear a visor and instead wear a veil that covers their mouth. It is
                        unknown if this veil serves a purpose or is simply decorative.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Insertion of troops and heavier combat is handled by single-seat SSTO aircraft
                        referred to as "Flight Units," which can shift form from a powerful fighter
                        craft to a bipedal mech for all-aspect combat: the unit also uses the legs of
                        the bipedal mode as landing gear.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        For fire support in ground
                        missions, YoRHa units can be assigned a small AI companion referred to as a Pod.
                        These hovering devices are primarily used to carry ranged weapons, but also
                        serve as an additional assistant to the YoRHa unit, dealing with trivial
                        mission-related issues and general questions to save contacting Operators. Pods
                        may offer advice against an android's current course of action, but ultimately
                        must obey all direct orders from the unit they were originally assigned to, even
                        those that go against YoRHa command's directives. They possess substantial
                        databases including historical records, and additional sensing gear, enhancing
                        the capabilities of YoRHa units without requiring them to carry the additional
                        systems themselves. They are also equipped with a series of manipulator limbs
                        for handling delicate objects or performing repairs, a variety of medical
                        supplies such as staunching gel and Logic Virus vaccines, and a powerful
                        searchlight to assist their android companion in navigating dark areas visually.
                        The firing interface for the Pod is provided by the android's far-field combat
                        system (FFCS). The Pod also allows their companion android to partake in the
                        human activity known as "fishing," though it is unclear if this is a result of
                        deliberate design.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        A YoRHa android's internal architecture is modular and can accept plug-in chips
                        to enhance the capabilities of the unit, allowing them to customize their
                        capabilities to suit a wide variety of potential missions. The chips are
                        hot-swappable by units in the field. The only necessary component is the main OS
                        chip which handles core functions such as their Black Box interface, NFCS and
                        FFCS, and an android can selectively enable or disable their additional sensors
                        (their system chips) as they see fit.
